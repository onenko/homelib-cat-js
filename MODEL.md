# Library Catalogue - Data Model

Data model should support all complex use cases, like:

- support of original art (novel), translated to some language, read as audiobook by an artist
- multivolume edition, when every volume includes some/few arts of an writer
- single or multivolume tematic editions, with different authors included.

## Item

Item is the main object of a library, it is tangible, it is bought and placed 
to a shelf and/or stored somewhere, example: ```paper book```.
